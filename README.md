# HaikuKitLab

GitHub repository dedicated to exploring and experimenting with the different Kits that make up Haiku’s powerful API!

This repo goes hand in hand with the KitLab article series where we dive deep into Haiku’s native development environment, showcasing examples, demos, and practical use cases for each Kit: https://www.haikuinsider.org/category/kitlab

The goal of HaikuKitLab is simple: learn, share, and build together.
Each example is crafted to help developers understand how the Haiku API works in real-world scenarios.

But this isn’t just a read-only repo — it’s meant to grow with the community!

If you’re experimenting with Haiku’s Kits, or have improvements, new examples, or fixes to suggest, we’d love your contributions.

Fork the repo, send a Pull Request, and help make it an evolving hub for Haiku development.

Let’s make Haiku development fun, open, and collaborative!
